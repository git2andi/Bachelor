\section{3D from Image}\label{3d from image}

Converting two-dimensional images into three-dimensional models is a challenge in the field of computer vision and 3D modeling. This section examines some of the methods used in converting 2D images into 3D models. This process has profound implications for various fields, including virtual reality, gaming and medical imaging. Techniques such as Magic 123 and Wonder3D are analyzed to demonstrate some core concepts.
