\chapter{Comparative Study}~\label{ch:comparative study}

This chapter deals with a systematic evaluation of the previously investigated methods for creating 3D models. This analysis is crucial for understanding the real-world applicability and effectiveness of each method. The aim is to compare the theoretical principles with the practical results and to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of each model under experimental conditions.

The chapter begins with a description of the experimental setup that was created to test these methods. This includes the specific conditions, frameworks and parameters used to ensure that the comparison is fair and the results reliable. 
The generation process of the same example prompt is then shown for each method. This section shows all the steps required to bring the result of each method into its final form in several iterations. Finally, the chapter highlights a thorough analysis of the results obtained from these experiments. This section not only presents the data, but also interprets them in the context of the theoretical background, limitations and potential applications of each method. The insights gained here are helpful for anyone who wants to understand the state of the art in 3D modeling and its practical implications in the real world.
