\chapter{Future Directions}~\label{ch:future}

In this chapter, the focus shifts to the future of automatic 3D model generation, an area with a lot of potential but complex challenges. This section aims to bridge the gap between current methods and the visionary goals of the field. It addresses the pressing issue of generative bias, which is a critical problem as these models increasingly influence society's perceptions. In addition, the chapter explores emerging trends that are shaping the future landscape of 3D modeling. It examines how recent innovations are redefining efficiency and accessibility in model creation, with a particular focus on novel approaches such as Luma-AI's Genie \citep{LumaAIGenie2023} and Gaussian Splatting \citep{kerbl3Dgaussians}.
