\section{Diffusion models}\label{diffusion Models}

Diffusion models have emerged as a prominent method in generative modeling, offering distinct advantages over traditional models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). They operate by progressively perturbing data with noise and then learning to reverse this process, a methodology that enables the generation of highly realistic and diverse new samples.

~\cite{yangdiffusionSummary} distingueshe between three main approaches that dominate the study of diffusion models, which are going to be discussed shortly: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) \citep{hoDDPMs,sohlDDPM}, Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) \citep{song2019SGM}, and Stochastic Differential Equations (Score SDEs) \citep{song2020score, song2021maximum}. Each of these models has its own set of strengths and challenges, contributing uniquely to the development of Diffusion Models.
