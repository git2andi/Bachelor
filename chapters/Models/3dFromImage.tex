\section{3D from Image}\label{3d from image}

The conversion of two-dimensional images into three-dimensional models represents a significant challenge in the domain of computer vision and 3D modeling. This section explores the methodologies and technologies employed in transforming 2D images into 3D models, a process that has profound implications in various fields, including virtual reality, gaming, and medical imaging. Techniques such as Magic 123 and Wonder3D will be thoroughly analyzed.

The capacity to create 3D models from images not only enhances the realism and immersion in digital experiences but also aids in practical applications like urban planning and product design. These technologies harness complex algorithms to interpret spatial information from flat images, presenting unique challenges like dealing with occlusions, varying lighting conditions, and perspective distortions
