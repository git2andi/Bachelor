\section{3D from Image}\label{3d from image}

The conversion of two-dimensional images into three-dimensional models represents a significant challenge in the domain of computer vision and 3D modeling. This section explores the methodologies and technologies employed in transforming 2D images into 3D models, a process that has profound implications in various fields, including virtual reality, gaming, and medical imaging. Techniques such as Magic 123 and Wonder3D will be thoroughly analyzed.
