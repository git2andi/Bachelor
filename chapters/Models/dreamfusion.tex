\subsection{Dreamfusion}
\label{dreamfusion}
DreamFusion leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) \citep{mildenhallNERF} and uses a novel technique called Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) \citep{pooleDreamfusion} which "generates high-fidelity coherent 3D objects and scenes for a diverse set of user-provided text prompts \citep{pooleDreamfusion}. However, it is important to note that for the practical purposes of this thesis, \emph{Stable} DreamFusion \citep{stable-dreamfusion}, is used,  which is an open-source variant of DreamFusion. This variant introduces some differences compared to the original model. Stable DreamFusion modifies the original Imagen model by incorporating Stable Diffusion \citep{rombachStableDiffusion}, a latent diffusion model. It also employs the "multi-resolution grid encoder [from torch-ngp] to implement the NeRF backbone" \citep{stable-dreamfusion} and uses the Adan optimizer as the default option \citep{stable-dreamfusion}.
