\subsection{Fantasia3D}\label{fantasia3D}

The model proposed by \citeauthor{chen2023fantasia3d} takes a different approach in generating 3D Models from text inputs. It differes in the fact that Fantasia3D ``disentangle[s] modeling and learning of geometry and appearance'' \citep{chen2023fantasia3d}. This is done to achieve finer detailed and realistic models after rendering in contrast to NeRFÃŸ@. Conventional NeRF uses volume rendering which combines the learning of the surface geometry with that of pixel colors, which makes them less effective for surface recovery.
