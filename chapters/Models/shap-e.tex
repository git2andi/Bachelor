\subsection{Shap-E}
\label{shap-e}

Shap-E involves training an encoder which "produces a latent representation of a 3D asset" \citep{junShapeE}. In a second step, a diffusion prior on the obtained latent representations is trained, conditioning it on images or text descriptions to capture additional information \citep{junShapeE}.
