\subsection{Point-E}
\label{point-e}

Point-E operates through a two-stage generation process, resulting in point clouds. The initial stage involves the creation of an image using the text-to-image model GLIDE \citep{nicholGLIDE}, which was "fine tuned on 3D renderings" \citep{nicholPointE}. In the next stage, known as the image-to-3D model, RGB point-clouds are created with a stack of diffusion models \citep{nicholPointE}.
