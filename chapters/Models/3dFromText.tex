\section{3D from Text input}\label{3d from text}

In recent years, the field of 3D model generation has witnessed a significant shift, with an increasing focus on generating 3D models from textual descriptions. This innovative approach leverages advancements in natural language processing and deep learning, allowing for the creation of 3D models based purely on textual input. This section delves into the mechanics and applications of such systems, with a specific emphasis on groundbreaking methods like Dreamfusion, Fantasia3D, and Magic 3D.

The ability to generate 3D models from text opens up a plethora of possibilities. For designers, artists, and architects, it translates to a more intuitive and accessible way to bring ideas to life. This technology also holds immense potential in education and entertainment, where it can be used to create interactive and engaging 3D content. In this section, the focus will be on how these systems interpret textual descriptions while explaining the challenges they face, such as ensuring accuracy and maintaining the fidelity of the generated models to the original text.
