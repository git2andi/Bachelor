\section{3D from Text input}\label{3d from text}

The ability to create 3D models from text opens up a wide range of possibilities. For designers, artists and architects, this means a more intuitive and accessible way to bring ideas to life. This section will focus on how these systems interpret text descriptions and explain the computational challenges they face.
